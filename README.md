##Variables/files
Based on information the following code info connects the provided data:
"x_test", "y_test", "subject_test", "x_train", "y_train", and "subject_train" are the primary downloaded data that is manipulated - comprising the results of two rounds of accelerometer testing.

These are combined into "full_test" and "full_train", then into "full_combined", using the "features" and "activity_labels" files to provide detail.

"full_combined" is lastly sliced into the "TidyDataset.txt" output.

(I wasn't sure what else to put in this file - more info is provided in "Codebook.md"!)
